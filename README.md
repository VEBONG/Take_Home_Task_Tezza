Test Automation Candidates Assignment

Using either Cypress or Selenium, build a test automation framework to automate as many test
scenarios as you can identify from the web registration form found at the URL below:
http://demo.automationtesting.in/Register.html
Perform appropriate assertions and once done, create a repository on a remote version control
server of your choice and push your framework there, then share the link with us.
N/B: Endeavor to set accessibility to public so that we can access it.
